use Morningtrain\WpNetsEasy\Classes\Payment\Address;
use Morningtrain\WpNetsEasy\Classes\Payment\Item;

            ->setShippingAddress(
                Address::create()
                    ->setAddressLine1($customer->address1)

    ->setCancelUrl(Route::route('payment-cancel', ['token' => $order->token]));

// Add items to payments
foreach($order->items as $item) {
    $payment->addItem(
        Item::create($item->sku)
            ->setName($item->name)
            ->setQuantity($item->quantity)
            ->setUnitPriceInclusiveTax($item->price)
    );
}

// Persist payment in NETS Easy
$response = $payment->createRequest();

if(wp_remote_retrieve_response_code($response) !== 201) {
    // Error handling when something was wrong with the payment
    wp_redirect($checkoutUrl);
    exit();
}

// Save payment reference to order
$order->setPaymentId($payment->getPaymentId());

// Redirect to payment page
wp_redirect($payment->getPaymentPageUrl());
exit();
```

### Handle existing payment
When a payment requrest has been created, the payment reference will be saved to the database.

#### Get payment
Payment is a model implementet with Eloquent. 
To get payments you can use all methods from Eloquent (see [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent#retrieving-models)).

You can use the custom method ```Payment::getByPaymentId($paymentId);```

```php
$payment = Payment::getByPaymentId($order->payment_id);
```

#### Terminate payment
To terminate payment, the customer must not have finished checkout.
You can use it on the cancel callback to avoid double payments later.

```php
$payment->terminate()
```

#### Check if payment is reserved

```php
$payment->isReserved()
```

#### Check if payment is charged

```php
$payment->isCharged()
```

#### Charge payment

```php
$payment->charge()
```
