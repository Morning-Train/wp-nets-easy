#### Auto charge payment
If your product allows you to auto charge payment. You can tell Nets Easy to charge the payment automatically before you persist the payment.

```php
$payment->autoCharge()
```

### Handle existing payment
When a payment requrest has been created, the payment reference will be saved to the database.

#### Get payment
Payment is a model implementet with Eloquent. 
To get payments you can use all methods from Eloquent (see [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent#retrieving-models)).

You can use the custom method ```Payment::getByPaymentId($paymentId);```

```php
$payment = Payment::getByPaymentId($order->payment_id);
```

#### Terminate payment
To terminate payment, the customer must not have finished checkout.
You can use it on the cancel callback to avoid double payments later.

```php
$payment->terminate()
```

#### Check if payment is reserved

```php
$payment->isReserved()
```

#### Check if payment is charged

```php
$payment->isCharged()
```

$payment->charge()
```
